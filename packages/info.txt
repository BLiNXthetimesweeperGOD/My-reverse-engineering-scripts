These scripts are for package formats.
- BIG (Tork: Prehistoric Punk)
- data_pack (Plants vs. Zombies, Nintendo DS/DSi) (Needs the simple file library to work!)
- HOT (Voodoo Vince Remastered, PC)
- MIT (BLiNX: the Time Sweeper) (also has a package creation script!)
- Petz Catz/Dogz 2+The Dog Island (Wii) (multiple extensions, but all files are in the same format)

Scripts that do multiple formats:
- Rubik's World.py (Rubik's World, Nintendo DS) (Needs the simple file library to work!)
